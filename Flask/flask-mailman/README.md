## Flask-Mailman Integration

This project aims at providing a template to integrate the `Flask-Mailman` package with a simple `Flask` project.

`Flask-Mailman` is a `Flask` extension providing simple email sending capabilities.

It was meant to replace unmaintained `Flask-Mail` with a better warranty and more features.

The template follows application factory pattern and uses `Flask-RESTful` to serve the endpoints.
